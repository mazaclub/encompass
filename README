Encompass - lightweight multi-coin client

Encompass consolidates support for various currencies into one wallet. It is a BIP-0044-compliant multi-currency wallet based on Electrum. This Encompass client uses Electrum servers of supported currencies to retrieve necessary data, so no "Encompass server" is necessary.

2. HOW OFFICIAL PACKAGES ARE CREATED
------------------------------------

contrib/encompass-release
 
The 'build' script will perform all the necessary tasks to 
create a release from release-tagged github sources

If all runs correctly, you'll find a release set in the 
contrib/encompass-release/releases directory, complete with 
md5/sha1 sums, and gpg signatures for all files. 

Additional documentation is provided in the README in that dir.
